# Aevum Engine

Aevum is an experimental OpenCL arithmetic engine for modular calculations modulo a Mersenne number `M_p = 2^p - 1`.

It is a modified derivative of GPUOwl/PRPLL. The main change is architectural: the original application-oriented GPU arithmetic has been exposed as a reusable register engine with a small C ABI. The API is designed so programs such as PrMers can adapt it to an interface similar in spirit to Marin's `engine::Reg` abstraction.

Aevum is not an official GPUOwl, PRPLL or Marin release.

## Project idea

The project combines two useful ideas:

- GPUOwl/PRPLL arithmetic and the paired integer NTT path over `GF(M31^2) x GF(M61^2)`
- a register-oriented engine model inspired by Marin, where algorithms manipulate opaque arithmetic registers through operations such as set, copy, square, multiply, add, subtract, import and export

This is not a source-level merge of GPUOwl and Marin. Aevum is derived from GPUOwl/PRPLL. Marin is credited as the design inspiration for the external register-engine shape used by the adapter.

## Authors and upstream projects

- GPUOwl was originally written by Mihai Preda: https://github.com/preda/gpuowl
- the imported upstream is George Woltman's GPUOwl/PRPLL fork: https://github.com/gwoltman/gpuowl
- the imported base commit is `294cc485ac8cf53c8b69144a3039832eda573849`
- Marin and its register engine were written by Yves Gallot: https://github.com/galloty/marin
- the Aevum engine API, register adaptation and PrMers integration were added by cherubrock-seb: https://github.com/cherubrock-seb

The original upstream README is preserved as `README_GPUOWL.md`. Exact provenance is recorded in `UPSTREAM.md`, and Aevum-specific changes are listed in `MODIFICATIONS.md`.

## Arithmetic backend

The reusable engine path selects GPUOwl's paired integer NTT configuration:

```text
GF(M31^2) x GF(M61^2)
```

The public API is declared in:

```text
src/EngineApi.h
```

The shared library is:

```text
build-engine/libaevum_engine.so
```

## Register API

The ABI exposes opaque engines and indexed registers. Important operations include:

```c
aevum_engine_create
aevum_engine_destroy
aevum_engine_set_u32
aevum_engine_set_words
aevum_engine_get_words
aevum_engine_copy
aevum_engine_prepare
aevum_engine_square_mul
aevum_engine_mul
aevum_engine_add
aevum_engine_sub_reg
aevum_engine_sub_u32
aevum_engine_equal
```

`aevum_engine_prepare` stores a transformed multiplicand for repeated multiplication. `aevum_engine_equal` compares two normalized register buffers directly on the GPU and avoids exporting very large residues for routine error checks. Register import and export use little-endian 32-bit words representing an integer modulo `2^p - 1`.

Small factors used by `square_mul` and `mul` are applied in the integer register domain with a scratch register. Residue export canonicalizes the final signed carry modulo `2^p - 1` with bounded word access, including positive and negative cyclic carry cases.

## Build

Ubuntu or Debian dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y g++ make ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers
```

Build the shared engine:

```bash
make engine-lib -j"$(nproc)"
```

Build the original command-line application as well:

```bash
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

Build the examples:

```bash
make examples
```

## Tests

Host arithmetic and source audit:

```bash
make test-host
```

Load the shared API and test automatic FFT3161 plan selection:

```bash
make test-engine-api
```

Run register examples on OpenCL device 0:

```bash
AEVUM_TEST_DEVICE=0 make test-examples-gpu
```

Run the focused small-factor GPU test:

```bash
AEVUM_TEST_DEVICE=0 make test-small-factor-gpu
```

## Examples

### FFT plan selection

```bash
./build-examples/fft_plans
```

This prints the selected FFT3161 plan for several exponents without starting a long PRP run.

### Register operations

```bash
./build-examples/register_ops 0 .
```

The sample checks:

- `3^2 * 3 = 27`
- prepared multiplication `7 * 5 * 2 = 70`
- register add and subtract
- register copy
- word import and export

### Verified power chain

```bash
./build-examples/power_chain 0 .
```

The sample executes repeated `square_mul` operations on the GPU and compares the complete exported integer with a CPU `boost::multiprecision::cpp_int` result. It also checks prepared multiplication followed by a small factor.

## Use from PrMers

PrMers loads Aevum as an optional in-process shared library through a small adapter derived from its existing `engine` interface.

## License

Aevum is licensed under GNU GPL version 3 because it is a modified derivative of GPUOwl/PRPLL. See `LICENSE`.

## Status

Aevum is experimental. It has produced matching PRP residues and correct P-1 results in PrMers testing, but performance depends strongly on exponent size, transform choice, GPU architecture and workload. Automatic Marin/Aevum selection is therefore recommended in PrMers.
